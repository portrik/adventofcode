# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

I'm delving into Dart this year. As usual, I'm working with a single project and making each day a class. It is not meant to be compiled, as the paths to input files are medium-rare-coded into the code.

## How to Run

| Command                      | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ```dart bin/main.dart DAY``` | This command will solve a selected date from a corresponding input file. The ```DAY``` parameter selects the day, e.g. ```01``` or ```12```. |
| ```dart test```              | Dart will run tests on each implemented day.                                                                                                 |
