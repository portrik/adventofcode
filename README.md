The year of ✌️.

## 2021

Year three. Throwing darts on the board at random. It's all tested, though.

## 2020

Year two. I want to learn rust so that's why there's rust. There are some growing pains but it seems to be working great.

My first year. Tried it with python. Did not get too far. Doing a remix in 2022.
